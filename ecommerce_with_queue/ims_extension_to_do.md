Inventory management. First scenario is when admin is updating the product, you need to lock the inventory store which is map/list. Second scenario is, a customer can temporarily use the product and then return after k days.. means the product will be available in the inventory again after k days. In this case you need a thread that will continuously check the queue and after the delay is expired it will add those items back to inventory. You need wait/signal mechanism here. So, when a user is purchasing a product for k days, this purchase record should be inserted in a priority queue(prioritised by least rental time).. this insertion logic is like a producer. On the other side, we have a infinitely running consumer thread that will check the peak of the priority queue and poll all such purchases which have been expired and will add them back to the inventory store. Here priority queue operations should be guarded with mutex and you need condition variables to implement wait/signal.... tried my best to explain let me know if you have any doubts.
